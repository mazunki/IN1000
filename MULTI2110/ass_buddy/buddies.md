# Buddy report

## Who are your buddies?
Our buddy group consists of three members: Silvia, Jens, and me.

While we haven't socialized too much I know Silvia has a background in psychological science back in Italy, and is currently pursuing a Master's in multilingualism. I was a bit surprised to hear her background, since the two fields initially felt quite unrelated, but it makes sense when she explained the psychological aspect of learning languages. Jens, on the other hand, is currently taking a bachelor's degree in Asiatic studies, after having spent several years abroad there. He also seems quite athletic, seeing as he does martial arts and parkour, even professionally.

Personally, I'm the programmer of the group, since I already have several years of experience in software, and have a Bachelor's in Robotics. I also work as a teacher, so I'm happy to answer programming-related questions which pop up.

## A summary of what your buddy group has done together?
Our group hasn't done too much together. Initially we tried to plan some meetups, but finding a common schedule was not as easy as we'd want. We have mostly communicated through Messenger, helping each other out when we get stuck on an exercise, or if we don't understand what we have to do for an assignment.

That said, I feel like we could make more time for each other with some motivation. Maybe we should set out to do some teambuilding exercises to build up the team cohesion... that'd probably be productive for all of us.

## What was useful about the buddy group?
The buddy group has been valuable to ask for help when we're unsure about what assignments are actually asking, and receiving feedback on what we have done, before delivering it. It's also great to meet others in the same community, as different people have different backgrounds, reasons and perspectives on things.

Personally, I've mostly discussed topics unrelated to the course itself with my peers, since I haven't really struggled too much with the assignments. I believe one can learn a lot simply by reaching out into kind-of-related topics, and combining different ideas from different fields. On top of that, I do enjoy feeling helpful towards my mates: it's nice to get different perspectives on the same task, reflecting on things I often just assumed was the case; and just knowing that they learned something.

## What was not so useful about the buddy group?
Our communication hasn't been great. We have had a very bazaar-like style of approaching the team, where someone would just drop a question, and a few days later someone would answer it (I'm guilty of this myself, *\*bonk!\**).

I think part of the reason we've left it kind of abandoned is because we haven't really had a reason to discuss too much up until the buddy report. To address this lack of teamwork, I believe we should probably make up some group activities first to establish a working communication channel, paving the way for more course-related topics.
