# Introduction:

Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects a significant number of children and adults worldwide. Individuals with ADHD face difficulties in focusing on tasks and maintaining attention for extended periods, which can negatively impact their academic, social, and occupational performance. While various forms of therapy are available for ADHD, there is still a need to explore innovative ways to help individuals with ADHD improve their attention and focus. Sound symbolism is an emerging field of research that explores the relationship between the sounds of words and their meanings. It is hypothesized that certain sounds in words can evoke certain sensations or emotions in individuals. Therefore, understanding sound symbolism may be beneficial for individuals with ADHD by providing a new and engaging tool to help them focus and improve their attention.

# Research Question

How does sound symbolism affect the attention and focus of individuals with ADHD compared to individuals without ADHD?


# Research methodology

The proposed study will employ a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design with a sample of children and adults diagnosed with ADHD and a control group without ADHD. Participants will be randomly assigned to either an experimental group or a control group. The experimental group will be presented with a list of words that contain sound symbolism, while the control group will be presented with a list of words that do not contain sound symbolism. The list of words will be selected based on previous research that has identified specific sounds that have consistent associations with certain meanings or emotions.

Participants in both groups will complete a computerized attention task that measures their ability to sustain attention and inhibit distracting stimuli. The study will use a pre-test and post-test design, with participants completing the attention task before and after exposure to the word lists. The performance of the two groups on the attention task will be compared to determine the effect of sound symbolism on attention and focus in individuals with and without ADHD.


# Expected challenges

One of the challenges of the proposed study is selecting appropriate words that have consistent sound symbolism associations. While previous research has identified specific sounds that are associated with certain emotions or meanings, these associations may not be consistent across all individuals. Therefore, the study will use a large pool of words to select the most appropriate ones for the study. Additionally, the study may face challenges in recruiting participants with ADHD and ensuring that they comply with the study protocol. To address these challenges, the study will use rigorous recruitment strategies and employ a detailed informed consent process to ensure that participants understand the study's requirements and their role in the study.

# Conclusion

The proposed study aims to explore the effect of sound symbolism on attention and focus in individuals with ADHD compared to individuals without ADHD. The study's findings may contribute to the development of new and innovative interventions for ADHD and shed light on the relationship between language, cognition, and attention. By identifying any differences in the effect of sound symbolism on attention and focus between individuals with and without ADHD, the study may provide valuable insights into the processing of language in individuals with ADHD.

The knowledge gained from the proposed study on the effect of sound symbolism on attention and focus in individuals with ADHD can have practical applications in both daily talk and research papers. Understanding the relationship between the sounds of words and their meanings can help individuals with ADHD find new and engaging ways to improve their attention and focus. For example, educators can incorporate sound symbolism into their teaching strategies to help children with ADHD focus on specific concepts or topics. By using words that contain sound symbolism, educators can evoke specific emotions or sensations in their students, making learning more engaging and effective.
