# Group 3: Food 

"the Sound Symbolism of Food"

## Delivery

- Decent usage of breaks to let the listener process what has been said, and
  connect dots.
- Felt a disconnect between the talker and the listeners, the presentation was
  quite «mechanical».

## Narrative

- The structure of the presentation is well-made, and examples make it easy to
  understand.
- Lack of explanation regarding how the researches tested their hypothesis.

## Slide design

- Decent usage of complementary examples to follow the talker, and not too
  distracting.
- Some slides had a bunch of both text and notation which is not really
  important to present the idea. Just dimming the font colour out would help, I
  think.


## Overall

Interesting topic, but I wished more details on the process of how sound
symbolism appears in language, and how people learn and adapt to speak in this
manner.
