"Trilled /r/ is associated with roughness, linking sound and touch across
surfaces than smooth surfaces."

## Delivery

- Balanced usage of pauses to separate statements and ideas, clear voice.
- Unappealing tone usage, too monotone. Using tone changes to focus on certain
  topics can increase attention span.

## Narrative

- Good introduction, order and relationship between statements
- I felt it was hard to separate the data from the core idea. It was a bit
  overwhelming to pay attention.

## Slide design

- Cute-looking aesthetics, little clutter, thus easy to look at and understand
  individual transparencies.
- Didn't feel a lot of a relationship between the slides, although this is
  mediated by the oral explanation.


## Overall

I believe having a bit over five minutes to explain the topics would alleviate
the mental fatigue of paying attention to the speaker. Another way to mediate
this would be to separate the speaker into two: one presenting the ideas, and
another speaking presenting the data to support the claims.
