# Group 2: Pokémon

"Sound symbolic patterns in Pokémon names"

## Delivery

- Excellent engagement with the listener, great usage of pauses, and clear
  voice.
- To some degree, expects listeners to know about the game; albeit I don't
  think this would be a blocker for understanding.

## Narrative

- Very inviting introduction, relaxing speaker, easy to understanding the
  points.
- Not too much validating data, which I think is fine.

## Slide design

- Quite strong correlation between what the speaker is talking about, and the
  visuals on screen. Engaging 
- A bit too much text on the slides. Should I spend my time listening to the
  speaker, or reading the slide? Related:

## Overall An overall excellent presentation. A very clearly presented paper,
albeit I'd like to hear more about how the paper correlates with other things
in linguistics and language. How can we use what we have learned when speaking
or studying/creating languages?
