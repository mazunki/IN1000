# Group 6: Alcohol 

"The sound of soft alcohol"

## Delivery

- Relaxed and clear speaking, with nice pauses in-between statements. This
  makes it easy to understand.
- Speaking in a monotone fashion drains the listener, causing a bunch of
  fatigue over time.

## Narrative

- Well-explained methodology of the research process, and what the conclusions
  are.
- Lacking an introduction made me only understand what the point of the
  research was until the very end of the presentation.

## Slide design

- Simple, to the point, and clear slides.
- The animations were quite slow, causing the reader to just wait for a visual
  update.


## Overall

Overall, the talk covers most of the bases for a good presentation, but I feel
like the order of each slide/topic is out of order. I believe re-ordering the
talking points to have the listener first understand what was being researched
would have helped. The talk also covered some lists which I felt were just
dragging out the time: I think this could have been skipped/sped up.
