# Group 5: Funniness 

"Playful iconicity"

## Delivery

- Relaxing to listen to the speakers, great usage of body language mixed with
  the slides.
- It felt distracting to go back and forth between speakers, even if this made
  it less dull.

## Narrative

- Good separation of data from ideas and topics. It was easy to "come back" if
  one fell out of the talk, thanks to obvious cuts.
- The data presented didn't provide much insight into what the data actually
  represented, or how it was captured.

## Slide design

- The amount of slides and the transition between them felt natural and
  balanced.
- Each page of the presentation has too much text on it, and, although
  colourful, is hard to read. Using more time on cleaning up the document by
  selecting fonts, colours, and positioning would've helped.


## Overall Having the presenters on each side of the presentation is a good
idea, and can often be useful in a back-and-forth discussion; but the
transition between speakers did not feel natural, and mostly just felt like a
distraction since I didn't know who I should be listening to at any moment.
