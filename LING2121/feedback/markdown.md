Overall, I think your idea of investigating onomatopoeic words and their relation to the size of birds is interesting, and could have some potential in understanding how we learn the names of animals.

## Feasibility and Methods

We were talking about how to collect data, and I believe the easiest way to do this is through an online survey. To do this, there are several online survey platforms available that are free to use, such as Google Forms or SurveyMonkey. I believe we will be using OSF (the Open Science Framework) to collect data during the course, but I am not too familiar with how it works yet.

On the platforms I mentioned, you can create multiple-choice questions and include images of birds to help participants identify them. You might want to include audio, but I don't think this is completely necessary for your study, albeit it could be insightful to compare the difference between audible and written form.

Regarding the creation of words, I suggested that you'd need a two-step questionnaire, where you first assert that the words you invent are representatitve of your suggested meaning before using them to research whether or not there is a relationship between the iconicity and the bird size. Alternatively, you could use words from other existing languages, as this would remove one variable from the equation.

## Research Questions

Your research questions seem relevant and well-defined: «*Is there a relationship between the onomatopoeia and the size of a bird?*», but I didn't see this as clearly presented in the proposal. I think it's important to have a clear question in mind when doing the data gathering and analysis.

We were discussing one of the ideas from your proposal, where you wanted to incorporate how easily children would learn different onomatopoeia, but I would recommend focusing solely on the investigation of onomatopoeic words and bird size for the sake of clarity and feasibility.

## Potential Problems

Regarding the issue of potential plagiarism, I agree with your concern and recommend that you cite Bodo Winter's work properly in your project, and make clear how your results differ to theirs. This could also be informative beyond the scope of our main analysis.
