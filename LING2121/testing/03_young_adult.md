## Without sound symbolism
In the novel, the protagonist is a woman named Lucy. Lucy is a complex character, and her feelings are often difficult to understand. She is in love with Sam, but she is also close friends with Mary, who is in love with Sam as well.

The novel ends on a bitter note. Lucy is unable to confess her feelings to Sam and Mary due to the complexity of the situation. This leads to a continuous circle of unexpressed love and unresolved feelings among the characters. The love triangle remains unresolved, leaving readers in suspense and longing for a sequel.


## With sound symbolism
In the novel, our protagonist is Lucy, a woman caught in a *tangle* of love. *Smitten* by Sam, her heart *thumps* each time she sees him. However, there's a *hitch*: her dear friend Mary is also *smitten* with the same Sam.

Her emotions *spiral* into a *storm*, a *hush-hush hurricane* swirling within her. The thought of betraying Mary *clamps* her heart, while her love for Sam *throbs*. Unable to *voice* her feelings to Sam, Lucy resorts to *scribbling* him a letter, her pen *dancing* across the paper as she *spills* her heart out.

The novel concludes with *resounding* tension. Lucy's feelings stay *bottled*, creating a *roiling sea* of unexpressed emotions and unresolved relationships. The love triangle remains *knotted*, leaving readers *dangling*, eager for the sequel.
