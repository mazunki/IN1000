## Without sound symbolism
Jake was your average teenager who was interested in two things - astronomy and insects. Even though he found the worms of the earth intriguing, it was the stars that most often captured his attention. After months of looking at the night sky and reading about celestial bodies, Jake decided to start a blog to share his knowledge. He decided his first post should be titled «Understanding stars».

He spent a lot of time writing the blog post, working each sentence into place to make it as accurate as possible. He wanted to share his knowledge about the stars in a clear and understandable way. When he finally published his first post, he thought about how other authors would feel when releasing an article. He imagined they'd mostly feel proud of their accomplishments, but Jake was feeling nothing but passionate.

The next morning, Jake woke up to a surprise. His blog post had been read by more people than he had expected. He had originally thought that his audience would mostly consist of his family. However, his post had reached a wider audience. This unexpected popularity of his post made Jake even more eager to share his knowledge about astronomy and earthworms on his blog.
