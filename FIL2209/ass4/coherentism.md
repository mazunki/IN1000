I get the feeling abductivism and coherentism analyze different aspects of epistemology: That is, abductivism studies whether or not a statement, by itself and by how we obtained it, is potentially and in actuality truthful. Coherentism, on the other hand, studies whether a statement is true in regards to the other truths we are aware of. From this observation, I don't think these two perspectives are necessarily contradictory nor incompatible.

Let's assume we take a statement, and we want to include it into our systematic web of knowledge: If it's incoherent with the rest of the system, we would probably take it for granted that it's false. I think that's a leap of faith in our system. If we keep disregarding everything which doesn't match what our paradigm sets as compatible, maybe that's because our knowledge set is biased in a false direction. A paradigm shift (Kuhn, 1962) might be required instead.

On the other hand, just because a statement fits our system does not mean it's necessarily true. If we include it in our system, we should have a solid ground for asserting it's extensible for other truths too. Otherwise, what point is there in including it? We would create falsehoods based on wrong assumptions regarding our compatible-in-some-cases statement.

I think coherentism makes sense as a tool to study the integrity of a system, but I think it's important to be aware of its problems, and know when to swap out certain truths when we deem them "legacy". Foundationalism, on the other hand, seems to be the closest we can get to knowing universal facts.
