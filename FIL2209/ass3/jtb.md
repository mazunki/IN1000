A posteriori beliefs are thoughts of knowledge which we get to after experiencing something from the real world. This is contrary to a priori knowledge, where knowledge about reality is obtained prior to actually requiring to observe anything in the real world.

The "benefit" of a prior knowledge is that there is no room for our experience having fooled us. This means that all mistakes we make during our attempts to reaching a priori knowledge will entirely come from mistakes in our own mind. I believe there can still exist erroneous a priori beliefs, which is why I believe we must justify them before we can use them as certainties.

How can we justify any given a prior belief, in order for it to become a valid a priori piece of knowledge? What benefit does it have over any a posteriori belief?

I think Principia Mathematica (Russel B.) is a good example of how we can create a foundation on which we can lay other truths. A foundation is a set of rules and laws we *decide* are true, because it's benefitial for us that they are. Given the basic rules, we can then extend other facts which all are justified under the universe in which we work. Should Principia Mathematica's universal laws crumble one day, it will still remain true that the extended knowledge we have researched from it is true under some "fictious" reality. Provided we are aware of this assumption, I do think it's reasonable to claim it's valid knowledge.

The benefit of having this type of knowledge is that even if we do lose faith in the basic rules, we can still continue to work under the old beliefs if we so choose to. Nothing would has changed, other than the preferred paradigm.
