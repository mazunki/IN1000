Externalist views of epistemology defend that we need not be aware of our justifications of beliefs in order for them to become knowledge. I believe many people live life without being "meta-aware" of their own thoughts, they simply do things because they believe it's the thing they should do. 

If knowledge is simply defined as the tool we use to take decisions in the real world, this seems like a good enough approach. I don't see a problem with including children or animals in it. After all, if they didn't have any knowledge at all, it would be impossible to distinguish their decisions from a completely random action. Mind you, many of the things children do ARE apparently random, as a means to and end: experimentation for the sake of learning. Have children fully developed their ability to gain knowledge, or do they have a completely correct or useful web of beliefs? No, probably not. But neither do adults.

On the other hand, if we define knowledge as the awareness of their own chain of thought, I don't believe neither children or animals have this. In fact, I don't even think most adults are (usually) aware of what they are thinking at any particular moment. They're just roaming their thoughts in an attempt to solve a problem, or enjoy life.

We might think children are closer to an internalist view on knowledge because of the stereotypical (but accurate) "Why? Oh. Why? Oh, okay. Why?..." questions they often make, but I believe this is mostly an act of curiosity of how the world works, and not on how their thoughts are related.
