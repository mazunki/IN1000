The logical empirists aim to remove all references to theoretical claims, based from pure thought, and rely entirely on empirical evidences for their scientific research. The idea behind this is that knowledge is either based on analytical a priori, or empirical a posteriori... but never a mix between thse two.

The only way we can prove how an empirical statement is true, is by having an observation of this reality, and we can't necessarily know the reasoning behind this occuring. Surely, there's some reason behind it, but we are not able to know what that is. We can only observe what does happen.

The eliminativist tries to remove all references to theoretical claims, methodically, similar to how Descartes tried to base all knowledge on pure knowledge by removing references to potential flaws in his thoughts.

I don't think it's sensible to remove all references to theoretical terms, unless we just make a set of observations, without making any claims about it. The reason why I think this is that the inferences we make from our observations, by themselves, are necessarily of a cause-consequence nature. A set of observations by themselves are not knowledge, since they are not justified.

Using observations, without justifying them, as a basis for the decisions and assumptions we make does serve some practical purpose, and I think that can have a positive outcome altogether, but we must always beware that their not necessarily true in nature.
