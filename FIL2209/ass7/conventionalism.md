Conventionalism, as explained by Poincar√© about geometry, says scientists need to agree upon which rules we use to do our science, in order to be able to reach truths. I feel this idea is a mistake, in a sense, since it obfuscates the problem at hand: it's hard (if not impossible) to reach synthetic a priori knowledge.

Approaching society with a mindset of reaching conventions is very useful, especially from a scientific and technologic point of view, as it allows us to work at a faster pace... it avoids having to reinvent the wheel for each new invention we make, and we're able to reach agreements without constant communication. What would we do if we didn't agree what the plus symbol in mathematics meant, for instance?

Nevertheless, I don't see how conventionalism can help us reach universal truths about the universe. It may help us work under a specific paradigm, and reach truths based on a set of already-established facts, but we still need to be aware of the rules and premises we've used, as if one pillar breaks, the whole house of cards might fall down. I get the impression that conventionalism is ignoring this idea entirely.

My main question here would be if it's possible, at all, to learn anything from outside a paradigm while being stuck inside it. Can we learn anything about the real world from simple boolean algebra, which isn't descriptive of the algebra itself?
