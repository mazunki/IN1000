If I have understood the no-miracles argument right, the realists claim that the inferred beliefs we make about the source of after-effect observations must be true because there are no such thing as a miracle. 

The usefulness of a theory does not need to correspond with its truthiness. We still use Newton's formula for the dynamics of masses, when we know, thanks to Einstein, that Newton's formula is too simple.
I believe this is also the case for observations, too. Realists take for granted that observations are true empirical beliefs, but it's still important to be aware in those cases that the knowledge can potentially be broken down.

Then again, similar to Descartes, his main argument for himself existing is that he exists because something is happening. When we look at cosmic radiation, something is happening. We don't necessarily know why or what is happening, but our observations are telling us that there's something going on. We can give that a name, and talk about it. Why do realists need to make further statements of their science?

It's a philosopher's job to seek what is true, but it feels wrong to pretend we know something for certain when we're simply unable to prove it true, and simply rely on assumptions. I don't think there's a benefit to this, and will lead to a dogmatic approach to science, and skeptics will try to evade science because "they've been wrong before, so we can't trust them!". This is counter-productive to scientific and research advancements, it feels.
