_What is your motivation to take this class, and what do you hope to learn and discuss?_

I'm enrolling in this feminist philosophy course driven by a blend of general experience with the topic, and as part of my requirements for the curriculum. Past experiences through various forms activism, from advocating for student rights to challenging traditional gender norms, has led me to this point. I'm here to gain more knowledge about traditional feminist thought, and how it has affected contemporary issues.

My reflections on gender, shaped by my own experiences as a non-binary person, has made me critically aware of the limitations and expectations imposed by societal/traditional gender roles. I'm familiar with how societal norms can be restrictive, influencing how we're perceived based on our appearance or behaviour. I want to delve deeper into philosophy of gender, and I hope this is a topic which we will touch throughout the course.

My background in activism, particularly in areas like neurodiversity and anti-bullying, also plays a big role in my life. As an autistic person, I have always struggled with understanding the arbitrary behaviours people have over each other, and I have often leaned on feminist theory to improve my own character as a person. I'm interested in how feminist philosophy can provide a framework for understanding and challenging the societal norms of interpersonality in general.

I'm particularly expecting to delve into the historical and contemporary stages of feminism. Understanding the evolution of feminist thought and the key figures who have shaped it is crucial for anyone engaged in social change.

In conclusion, I don't think feminism is restricted to the classical idea of liberating women (which is still very much needed in many places of the world), but I think it provides a framework on how we should be inclusive of one another, regardless of their backgrounds: in both an interpersonal matter---be nice to each other---, and to breach socioeconomical gaps between gender, race, neurotypes, ethnicities, religion, e.g.

Take care! :)
