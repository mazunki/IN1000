hi feroz, 
i've been working on an initial draft/outline for my topic for the semester assignment for a couple of weeks. the main theme is attempting to lay the grounds for a better approach to gender.

[draft follows in attachment]

# follow-up
i'm aware that my ideas can seem to overshadow some of the history of feminism and their battles, and i believe i should somehow address how these fights could coexist within the new framework. do you have any thoughts, ideas, or questions? thanks! see you on friday
