# against marriage and motherhood

claudia card's essay "against marriage and motherhood" opens up a critical dialogue on traditional family structures. reflecting on this through my own experiences and cultural observations, especially regarding polycular relationships, personal independence, and the family dynamics in norway and spain, offers a fresh perspective.

## independent upbringing

my upbringing in a small spanish town was somewhat unconventional. largely raised through online communities and without a traditional family structure, i learned to navigate life quite independently. this experience, often viewed as lacking parental guidance by my friends, in fact, fostered being able to make my own choices from an early age. instead of learning things directly from my parents and biological family, i would instead seek advice from friends, their parents, the internet, and other sources. this exemplifies the idea that family can take many forms and still provide a solid foundation for growth.

## polycular relationships

polycular relationships, as i see them, are the new and improved form of relationships. they're about people coming together, setting boundaries, and sharing responsibilities based on mutual consent. it's a system where everyone contributes according to their ability and receives support as needed (much like marxism, lol). this approach challenges the conventional norms (where people have a preconceived idea of what it means to be in a relationship) and provides a supportive environment. this extends to the upbringing of children, who can receive diverse forms of care from different beings in their surroundings.

## norway vs. spain

the contrast between norwegian and spanish family structures is striking. in norway, there's a push for early independence, supported by government initiatives, whereas in spain, familial dependency more often than not extends into adulthood. this dependency can limit personal and economic freedom, which again is limiting to the growth of a person, and their pool of choices. when your choices are set by your requirement to first survive, we aren't really acting as free individuals.

## licenses

card goes into the topic of getting a license to be in cohabitancy with another person. this idea, i believe, can and probably should be extended to parenting licenses. obviously, this is a controversial topic, but there are many dysfunctional families, where the kids grow up to be traumatized by their upbringing. of course, implementing such a license could easily come with issues such as accidental racial segregation, economical status difference, or otherwise governmental power abuse.

## conclusion

while i haven't really touched on why card believes we are ill-advised to strive for equal rights to marry, i very much agree with what she said: if marriage itself is a broken concept, it makes no sense to desire participation in it.

as she also mentions, not wanting to participate in it does not mean we shouldn't have the same rights to participate in it as everyone else. i am very much a person who wants to abolish broken ideas, but i also believe that abolition is more often than not as simple as simply rejecting it. it must come by steps, and i believe that seeking to reform what it means to marry is easier and more productive than attempting to destroy the whole thing. tldr: i think more people should learn from polyamorous theory.
