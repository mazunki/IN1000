I would transcribe the given audio file as [ 'sɹɒpcɳ 'sɹiːstn 'ɑlcptʰ ], although I found multiple part of this activity to be quite hard:

- First, I found it hard to actually distinguish the order in which different phonemes appeared, even after listening to the audio file in segments hundreds of times. 
- I also found it hard to distinguish which sound was actually appearing in each location. As an example: is there a ⟨t⟩ at the very beginning? I am simultaneously hearing, and not hearing it. 
- I don't clearly hear any vowel in the word(s?), except the single instance of an ⟨ɑ⟩. 

After "deciding" on what phonemes I'm actually hearing, I found it fairly trivial to both replicate the sounds myself, and to find the proper IPA symbol for the decided-upon sound by using the IPA chart. Having said this, I am nowhere near confident my attempt is correct.


PS: As a Vim-user sidenote, I'm seeing that I should probably configure my text editor to easily insert all these fancy symbols. If you happen to know... Is there any well-known way to tackle the IPA in Vim? LaTeX is nice for nice-looking results, but in my experience I prefer to work with UTF-8 markdown instead of having a bunch of boilerplate commands. Seeing the IPA symbols directly when writing is much cleaner and thus easier to tinker with. Then again, there's probably not a very huge overlap between lingustics and Vim users.
