toki!

nimi ni mili mazunki~

My name is mazunki, and I've recently started learning a bit of toki pona, as you may be able to see from my greeting above :)

I am mainly a software developer, finishing my degree in Robotics and Intelligent Systems, but also pursuing a degree in Philosophy. I am passionate about a few different things, and I easily get distracted... but I usually get things done before the deadlines are due. I speak four languages natively: Spanish, Catalan, Norwegian, and English. I've considered learning Japanese soon, too.

I find the history and usage of conlangs (constructed languages) quite interesting. There are esoteric, auxiliary, international and even fantastical conlangs... and probably a few variants I forgot to mention. Auxiliary languages are used in many places, especially when you're travelling. It's useful to get your point across even when you don't speak a language at all. Nowadays, the international de-facto auxiliary language is English due to imperialism and globalisation, although this has not always been the case (and still isn't in many parts of the world, e.g Spanish or Standard Arabic)!

The interesting fact of the day is that there are currently around a thousand native speakers of Esperanto, and probably around a hundred thousand people who can confidently speak it as a second language (Lindstedt, 2006). For a language that was created artificially in 1887, I think that's quite impressive.

mi tawa, o pona!
