Phenomenal Conservatism, in short terms, claims that any belief is self-justified on the premise that the person has had some sort of perception of the potential fact. I think it's important to distinguish two types of justification here: justifying the belief does not necessarily mean you're also justifying it as knowledge.

Everyone has the right to believe whatever they want, either with or without reason. If they believe the sun is red, because they live in an area where the atmosphere causes the sun to glow differently than what we're accostumed to, why shouldn't we let them enjoy their own belief? It would be unempathic to claim their belief is not justified, a failure to recognize their perceptions and feelings.

Having said this, I do believe many people take a leap from justified beliefs to justified pieces of knowledge, without much thought behind this. We often see this trend inbetween crowds of anarco-capitalists, where they sensationalise individualism, without recognising the context in which people live.

In order to claim something is a ("universal") truth, it is not enough to have a justified true belief of The Thing. What is missing for a belief to become knowledge (even if this knowledge is erroneous)? I am not sure, but being able to potentially verify the truth value of the fact is a bare minimum. As David Hume would, I also agree with the author in that we can live our lives assuming the knowledge we have to be true until we recognize we've been wrong... but that's not to say we mustn't be aware of them, or the potential flaws in our assumptions.
