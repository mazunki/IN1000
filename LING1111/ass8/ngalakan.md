fluent speaker died in 2004).

### What are the three allomorphs of the second-person possessive suffix? What determines which allomorph is used?

By separating the words into different groups based on the ending as such:

**Group 1**

- bakoɭ	bakoɭŋgi
- wom	womŋgi
- balmaɳa	balmaɳaŋgi
- ɖarbija	ɖarbijaŋgi
- ɖaɖa	ɖaɖaŋgi
- gapuɭa	gapuɭaŋgi

**Group 2**

- woʧwoʧ	woʧwoʧgi
- jirkup	jirkupgi
- womboroʈ	womboroʈgi
- got	gotgi
- waɲʤat	waɲʤatgi
- guɭaʔ	guɭaʔgi
- balʧuɖaʔ	balʧuɖaʔgi

**Group 3**

- malk	malki
- bak	baki
- giŋalk	giŋalki

we can observe three different allomorphs for the second-person possesive morphome: —ŋgi, —gi, and —ki.

The latter one only appears if we're already ending on an unvoiced velar plosive /k/, and the sound merges with the ending.

Otherwise, the suffix is —gi. The allomorph —gi apperas whenever the base word ends on a voiceless consonant, but if the last stem of the noun ends in a voiced phoneme, we insert a nasalized velar sound between the suffix and the word to make the suffix more natural, giving us the /ŋgi/ allomorph.
