"""
	This program is made as a solution to activity 5 of the 2nd assignment of
	IN1000 at UiO, fall 2019.

	The proposed idea is to input a chess scenario, either as an absolute matrix,
	or by giving the set of movements according to FIDE's standard algebraic notation.
	Check Appendix C at https://www.fide.com/fide/handbook.html?id=171&view=article

	The output will be a list of movements possible to do checkmate. `None` if there is no
	immediate checkmate.
