*Nussbaum anvender sin "capabilities approach" på dyr i boken "Justice for Animals". Redegjør for hva tilnærmingen består i, og drøft dens styrker og svakheter med tanke på dyr - les: ulike typer dyr -  til forskjell fra mennesker.*

## Capabilities approach
The capabilities approach, created and developed by Martha Nussbaum, has significantly influenced contemporary ethical and political philosophy, offering a profound framework for evaluating human well-being and social justice. Initially addressing the complexities of human development and to critique the inadequacies of prevailing utilitarian and GDP-centric measures of prosperity, Nussbaum's theory articulates a set of fundamental human capabilities necessary for a life of dignity. Her work, deeply rooted in Aristotelian ethics and modern political liberalism, argues that true justice requires not only the availability of opportunities but also the actual ability of individuals to pursue a flourishing life. While this approach has primarily focused on human concerns, Nussbaum's recent application to the realm of non-human animals in "Justice for Animals: Our Collective Responsibility" marks a significant expansion of her ethical vision. This essay explores the transition of the capabilities approach from its human-centric origins to its encompassing embrace of animal rights, assessing its strengths and potential limitations in redefining our moral obligations towards all sentient beings.

## The Capabilities Approach: An Overview
### The Initial Framework
Martha Nussbaum's capabilities approach, in its original form, proposes a shift from traditional assessments of well-being that rely on economic prosperity or subjective happiness towards a more nuanced evaluation of what individuals are actually able to do and to be. The approach identifies a list of essential capabilities, such as life, health, bodily integrity, emotion, practical reason, affiliation, and control over one's environment, as indispensable for supporting a dignified human existence. These capabilities represent not just the minimum conditions of a life worth living but also encompass the breadth of opportunities available for individual choice and development.

Central to Nussbaum's theory is the conviction that justice demands more than the mere provision of resources or the formal assurance of rights; it requires the actual freedom to make meaningful choices and engage in activities that contribute to one’s well-being. Her initial focus on human capabilities was motivated by a desire to address global inequalities and to advocate for social policies that ensure not just equality of opportunity but also the real possibility for all individuals, regardless of their background, to achieve a full and rich life.

### Ethical Expansion to Include Non-Human Animals
Building on this foundation, Nussbaum's later work extends the ethical consideration of capabilities to non-human animals, challenging the anthropocentric boundaries of traditional moral and political theories. By applying the capabilities approach to animals, she argues for a reevaluation of how societies recognize and respect the intrinsic value and rights of animals to flourish according to their species-specific nature. This expansion does not merely append animals to the list of concerns within the existing framework but calls for a radical rethinking of our ethical responsibilities, advocating for legal and social reforms that acknowledge the moral significance of animal well-being and agency.

Nussbaum's pioneering effort to include animals within the scope of the capabilities approach highlights the universality of the need for a life of dignity, beyond the human species. It encourages a broader ethical dialogue that considers the diverse ways in which all sentient beings interact with the world, urging a shift in societal practices and laws to reflect a more inclusive and compassionate understanding of justice.
