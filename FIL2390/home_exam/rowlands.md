- *Personal Anecdote*: Rowlands begins with a personal story about his experiences with his dogs and his son, emphasizing the care and solicitude the dogs showed toward his son, which led him to ponder animal morality.
- *Academic Dispassion*: He addresses the potential criticism of anthropomorphism and emphasizes that while he will adopt a more clinical tone in the main text, his experiences with his dogs are relevant to his inquiry into animal morality.
- *Acknowledgements*: Rowlands acknowledges the intellectual debts to Marc Bekoff and Frans de Waal, whose work on animal behavior and emotions has been influential to his own thinking.

Introduction and Major Themes

- *Central Question*: Rowlands addresses the question of whether animals can be moral, which has traditionally been met with skepticism by philosophers. He outlines his intention to challenge this skepticism.
- *Conceptual Focus*: The book is primarily concerned with conceptual rather than empirical questions. Rowlands aims to explore whether animals can act for moral reasons, based on emotions that have identifiable moral content.
- *Structure*: The book is organized into chapters that address various aspects of moral behavior, emotions, agency, and the philosophical implications of these concepts.

Key Arguments

Empirical Evidence and Philosophical Analysis

- *Philosophical Challenges*: He addresses the philosophical challenges to the idea of animal morality, including issues related to consciousness, self-consciousness, rationality, and the nature of moral properties.

Conclusion

- *Broader Implications**: The book concludes with reflections on the broader ethical and philosophical implications of recognizing animals as moral subjects, which could influence debates on animal rights and our ethical responsibilities toward animals.s
